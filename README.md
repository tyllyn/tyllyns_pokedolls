# Tyllyn's Pokedolls

## Overview

Minecraft mod for Java 1.20.1 to introduce various Pokémon dolls (and other related items), often inspired by Cobblemon models. This is still an early work in progress.

## Notes

- Does not contain recipes for the dolls, so will need to be given through commands. Dolls can be given by `/give @p pokedoll_mod:pokedoll_name`, replacing `name` with the lowercase name of the Pokémon.
- Models are built out through Blockbench, and I'm still learning that, so models may likely change in the future.
- This is built around and for a Cobblemon server running with the Fabric framework, so all requirements will revolve around that.
